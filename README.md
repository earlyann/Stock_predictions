Using support vector machine to predict if a stock will have a positive annual return


Predict the labels for new data: You can use the predict method of the SVM model to predict the labels for new data. For example, you could use the model to predict whether a new set of weight values X1 to X6 will result in a positive or negative annual return Y1


The accuracy, precision, and recall scores are all in the range of 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.

Accuracy: 0.95
Precision: 0.95
Recall: 1.00

The accuracy score represents the proportion of correctly classified examples in the dataset, and can be interpreted as the overall performance of the model. In your case, an accuracy score of 0.95 means that 95% of the examples in the dataset were classified correctly by the model.

The precision score represents the proportion of true positive examples among all the examples that were classified as positive by the model. In your case, a precision score of 0.95 means that 95% of the examples that were classified as positive by the model were actually positive.

The recall score represents the proportion of true positive examples among all the actual positive examples in the dataset. In your case, a recall score of 1.00 means that the model correctly identified all the positive examples in the dataset.

Overall, your SVM model seems to have performed well on the dataset, with high accuracy, precision, and recall scores. However, it's important to keep in mind that these scores are based on the training set, and the true performance of the model on new, unseen data may be different. Therefore, it's a good idea to also evaluate the model on a separate test set to get a more accurate estimate of its performance
